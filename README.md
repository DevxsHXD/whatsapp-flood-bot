# WhatsApp flooding user bot

Note: For educational purposes only  

This is a code for a whatsapp userbot that send flood messages. After running `npm start` you can scan the qr code on the terminal by going to Whatsapp-> Linked devices.
After that you may find a text `bot is ready` in the terminal. (You can test it by sending `!test` in any chat on your whatsapp). Now you can go to any chat on your whatsapp and send flood messages by the command `!flood [number of messages] [text]`. (eg: `!flood 30 Hello!`).  

PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ANYONE! FLOOD MESSAGES ARE ANNOYING! USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! IF YOU DO THIS, THERE IS A HIGHER CHANCE OF YOUR WHATSAPP ACCOUNT GETTING BANNED! USE THIS CODE ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!!!
